# Session 006 — Learning System (Phase 6)

## Date
2026-03-09

## What Was Done

### Pre-Implementation
- `docs/research/learning-system.md` — Prior art survey (Udemy, Coursera, freeCodeCamp, Khan Academy), enrollment UX patterns, progress calculation strategies, certificate verification approaches
- `docs/adr/017-learning-architecture.md` — Lesson content discriminated union, quiz engine reuse, auto-certificate flow, single-page accordion editor, flat count progress, soft/hard delete strategy

### @snaplify/learning Package (75 tests)
- **types.ts** — All learning types: LearningPath, LearningModule, Lesson, Enrollment, LessonProgressRecord, Certificate, input types, LessonContent discriminated union (article/video/quiz/project/explainer), CurriculumNode, CertificateData
- **validators.ts** — Zod validators: updateLearningPathSchema, createModuleSchema, updateModuleSchema, updateLessonSchema, lessonContentSchema (discriminated union on type)
- **progress.ts** — Pure functions: calculatePathProgress, isPathComplete, getNextLesson, getLessonStatus, getCompletionPercentageByModule
- **certificate.ts** — Pure functions: generateVerificationCode (SNAP-{base36}-{hex8}), formatCertificateData, buildVerificationUrl
- **curriculum.ts** — Pure functions: flattenLessons, countLessons, calculateEstimatedDuration, formatDuration, buildCurriculumTree, reorderItems
- **index.ts** — Full exports of all modules
- **package.json** — Added @snaplify/explainer, @snaplify/editor, zod deps
- **tsconfig.json** — Excluded __tests__ from build

### Reference App Types
- Added to `lib/types.ts`: LearningPathListItem, LearningPathDetail, EnrollmentItem, CertificateItem, LearningPathFilters

### Reference App Server Layer
- **lib/server/learning.ts** — Full CRUD:
  - Path: listPaths, getPathBySlug, createPath, updatePath, deletePath (soft), publishPath
  - Module: createModule, updateModule, deleteModule (hard), reorderModules
  - Lesson: createLesson, updateLesson, deleteLesson (hard), reorderLessons
  - Enrollment: enroll (idempotent), unenroll
  - Progress: markLessonComplete (upsert → recalc → auto-certificate at 100%)
  - Queries: getEnrollment, getUserEnrollments, getUserCertificates, getCertificateByCode, getLessonBySlug, getCompletedLessonIds
  - Helper: ensureUniquePathSlug

### Routes (7 route groups, 14 files)
- `/learn` — Browse published paths with difficulty filter
- `/learn/[slug]` — Path detail + curriculum, enroll/unenroll actions
- `/learn/[slug]/[lessonSlug]` — Lesson viewer + mark complete action
- `/learn/create` — Create path form → redirect to edit
- `/learn/[slug]/edit` — Full editor with 10 form actions (updatePath, publish, add/update/delete/reorder modules and lessons)
- `/certificates/[code]` — Public certificate verification (no feature flag)
- `/dashboard/learning` — User enrollments + certificates

### Components (10 Svelte files)
- PathCard, ProgressBar, CurriculumAccordion, EnrollButton, LessonViewer, LessonNav, CertificateBadge, PathEditor, ModuleEditor, LessonEditor

### Nav Integration
- Added "Learn" link to Nav.svelte

## Decisions Made
- Flat progress calculation (completedLessons / totalLessons * 100)
- SNAP-{base36_timestamp}-{hex_random_8} verification code format
- Single-page accordion editor (not wizard)
- Soft delete for paths, hard delete for modules/lessons
- Certificate verification route exempt from feature flag
- Idempotent enrollment (re-enroll returns existing)
- Auto-certificate issuance at 100% (no manual step)

## Test Results
- @snaplify/learning: 75 tests (validators: 24, progress: 21, certificate: 8, curriculum: 22)
- All packages: build passes (12/12)
- All packages: tests pass (586 total across all packages)
- Typecheck: 11 pre-existing errors (zero new), 57 warnings

## Open Questions
- Quiz-type lessons: should "mark complete" require passing score? Currently marks complete regardless
- Module/lesson reorder: currently uses sequential DB updates; batch update would be more efficient
- Cover image upload integration (deferred to Phase 7+ per plan)

## Next Steps
- Phase 5b: GSAP scroll animations, interactive sections, animation authoring UI
- Phase 7+: Ratings/reviews, co-instructors, image upload, search integration
