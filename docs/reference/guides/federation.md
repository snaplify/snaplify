## What Federation DOES Enable in v1

1. **Follow users across instances** — Mutual follow with Accept/Reject lifecycle
2. **See federated content** — When someone you follow publishes, a Create activity is logged
3. **Like content across instances** — Like activities are sent outbound
4. **Single sign-on** — OAuth2 SSO between trusted instances (Model B)
5. **Discover users** — WebFinger lookup (`@user@instance.com`)
6. **Actor profiles** — JSON-LD actor documents with public keys
7. **NodeInfo** — Instance metadata discovery

## What Federation Does NOT Enable in v1

1. **No remote content persistence** — Inbound Create/Update/Delete/Like/Announce are logged but NOT stored locally
2. **No cross-publishing** — Content has a single origin instance
3. **No server mirroring** — No content sync between instances
4. **No federated communities** — Communities are local-only (standing rule #5)
5. **No cross-instance community interaction** — Cannot join or post in remote communities
6. **No activity delivery** — Activities are logged in the `activities` table but not yet delivered to remote inboxes via HTTP
7. **No HTTP Signature signing on outbound requests** — Verification of inbound signatures is implemented

## FAQ: Cross-Publishing, Mirroring, and Cross-Site Interaction

### Can communities mirror projects/communities from another site?

**No.** Communities are local-only in v1 (standing rule #5). There is no AP Group support and no remote content persistence. Inbound Create/Update/Delete activities are stub handlers that log the activity but do not store the content locally.

### Can I publish projects to multiple sites?

**No.** Content has a single origin instance. Federation is outbound-only: when you publish locally, a Create activity (AP Article) is logged. There is no cross-posting or multi-origin storage mechanism.

### Can I interact with communities/hubs from different sites?

**No.** Communities are local to each instance. Users can follow remote *users* and like federated *content*, but cannot join or post in remote communities.

### Can I at server level say "this server mirrors that one"?

**No.** No mirroring feature exists. Inbound content is logged but not stored. Remote actor profiles are cached (24h TTL) in the `remoteActors` table, but content is not persisted.

### Can I OAuth with one site and cross-publish?

**Partially.** OAuth2 SSO (Model B) lets you authenticate on Instance A and create a linked account on Instance B via the `federatedAccounts` table. But this only creates an identity link — it does NOT enable cross-publishing. Each instance maintains its own content independently.

### What would need to be built for full federation?

These are all post-v1.0.0 features requiring significant protocol work:

1. **AP Group support** — For federated communities (`type: "Group"`)
2. **Inbound content persistence** — Store remote Articles/Notes locally
3. **Activity delivery** — Actually deliver outbound activities to remote inboxes via signed HTTP POST
4. **Cross-publishing API** — Publish to multiple origin instances
5. **Server mirroring protocol** — Full content sync between instances
6. **HTTP Signature signing** — Sign outbound requests with actor keypairs

## Federation Architecture

### Supported Activity Types (9)

| Activity | Direction | Implementation |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Create** | Outbound | `federateContent()` → logged in activities table |
| **Create** | Inbound | `onCreate` callback → log only (stub) |
| **Update** | Outbound | `federateUpdate()` → logged |
| **Update** | Inbound | `onUpdate` callback → log only (stub) |
| **Delete** | Outbound | `federateDelete()` → logged |
| **Delete** | Inbound | `onDelete` callback → log only (stub) |
| **Follow** | Both | Full lifecycle: pending → accepted/rejected |
| **Accept** | Both | Updates followRelationship status |
| **Reject** | Both | Updates followRelationship status |
| **Undo** | Both | Deletes followRelationship (for Follow) |
| **Like** | Outbound | `federateLike()` → logged |
| **Like** | Inbound | `onLike` callback → log only (stub) |
| **Announce** | Inbound | `onAnnounce` callback → log only (stub) |

### Object Types

| AP Type | Snaplify Type | Builder |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Article | project, article, guide, blog | `contentToArticle(item, author, domain)` |
| Note | comment, short post | `contentToNote(comment, author, domain, parentUri)` |
| Tombstone | deleted content | Via Delete activity |

## OAuth2 SSO Flow (Model B)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User on Instance B
    participant B as Instance B
    participant A as Instance A

    User->>B: "Login with Instance A"
    B->>A: WebFinger: /.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:@{domain_a}
    A-->>B: Returns oauth endpoints
    B->>A: Redirect to /api/auth/oauth2/authorize?client_id=...&redirect_uri=...
    A->>User: Show login form (if not logged in)
    User->>A: Authenticate
    A->>A: storeAuthCode(code, userId, clientId, redirectUri)
    A-->>B: Redirect to callback with ?code=...
    B->>A: POST /api/auth/oauth2/token (code, client_id, client_secret)
    A->>A: consumeAuthCode(code, clientId, redirectUri) — single-use, 10-min TTL
    A-->>B: Returns access_token + user info
    B->>B: Create/link local account via federatedAccounts table
    B-->>User: Logged in!
```

### OAuth2 Setup

1. Register Instance B as an OAuth client on Instance A (creates `oauthClients` row)
2. Add Instance A's domain to Instance B's `auth.trustedInstances[]` config
3. User on Instance B clicks "Login with Instance A"
4. Standard OAuth2 authorization code flow with PKCE

### SSO Limitations

- Only creates an identity link — does NOT sync content
- Requires pre-registration of OAuth clients (manual process)
- Auth codes are in-memory (production should use Redis)
- No automatic account provisioning (user must complete signup on Instance B)

## Database Tables Used by Federation

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `remoteActors` | Cache of remote AP actor profiles (24h TTL) |
| `activities` | Log of all inbound/outbound AP activities |
| `followRelationships` | Federation-level follow state (pending/accepted/rejected) |
| `actorKeypairs` | RSA-2048 keypairs per user for HTTP Signatures |
| `federatedAccounts` | Links local users to remote AP actor identities |
| `oauthClients` | Registered OAuth2 clients (other Snaplify instances) |

## Inbox Processing

When an activity arrives at `/users/[username]/inbox` or `/inbox`:

1. Parse the JSON-LD activity body
2. Route to the appropriate `InboxCallbacks` handler based on `activity.type`
3. For Follow/Accept/Reject/Undo: Full implementation — updates `followRelationships` table
4. For Create/Update/Delete/Like/Announce: **Stub implementation** — logs the activity to the `activities` table with status `'processed'` but does NOT persist the content locally

```typescript
// v1 inbox callbacks
{
  onFollow: async (activity) => {
    // Insert followRelationship (pending), auto-accept in v1
  },
  onAccept: async (activity) => {
    // Update followRelationship → accepted
  },
  onReject: async (activity) => {
    // Update followRelationship → rejected
  },
  onUndo: async (activity) => {
    // Delete followRelationship (if Follow)
  },
  onCreate: async (activity) => {
    // LOG ONLY — does not store remote content
  },
  onUpdate: async (activity) => {
    // LOG ONLY
  },
  onDelete: async (activity) => {
    // LOG ONLY
  },
  onLike: async (activity) => {
    // LOG ONLY
  },
  onAnnounce: async (activity) => {
    // LOG ONLY
  },
}
```

## Federation Hook Pattern

Server modules call federation functions after mutations when the federation flag is enabled:

```typescript
// In content.ts
export async function onContentPublished(db, contentId, config) {
  if (!config.features.federation) return;
  await federateContent(db, contentId, config.instance.domain).catch(() => {});
}
```

Key points:
- Always check `config.features.federation` first
- Always `.catch(() => {})` — federation failures must never break local operations
- Activities are logged to the `activities` table with status `'pending'`
- No actual HTTP delivery happens in v1 (activities remain in pending state)
